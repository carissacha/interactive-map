    <h1>Middle School â€“ A Place of Growth and Friendship</h1>
    <p>This is also where I spent most of my time growing up in Hong Kong. I still continue to talk to my friends who I shared these memories with, and I would consider them some of my closest friends now since they know so much about me.</p>
    
    <p>During my time at ISF, I spent most of my time on the soccer and golf team. In my later years at the school, I also joined the tennis and basketball teams, which added to my experience and growth as an athlete.</p>
