    <h1>NYC – A Second Home</h1>
    <p>New York City holds a special place in my heart, as it is where my grandparents live. It's like a second home, and I spent most of my summers with them. During these summer visits, I attended a dance camp called Steps on Broadway. It was an experience that helped shape who I am today. On weekends, we'd take the LIRR to visit my uncle, who lived in Long Island at the time. Those weekends were filled with laughter and family time.</p>
    
    <p>Those trips to NYC were not only fun, but they were also the first time I began to struggle with my identity. It was a confusing and formative time, but it also helped me grow and understand who I truly am. I’ll always have the memories of spending my summers in the city with my grandparents, learning dance, and exploring everything NYC has to offer.</p>
