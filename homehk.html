    <h1>Home in Hong Kong</h1>
    <p>This is where I grew up. So many memories are held within these walls, especially in my bedroom: where I spent countless sleepless nights, whether lost in thought, studying for exams, or simply dreaming about the future. The same room that once held my childhood toys slowly transformed as I grew older, reflecting different phases of my life. No matter where I go, this will always be my permanent home. It’s more than just a physical space; it’s where my family is, where laughter echoes from past celebrations, and where I always find comfort. We haven’t moved since primary school, so every corner of this home carries a memory—of me growing up, of change, of familiarity. Sometimes, I like to dig through my old things—forgotten notes, childhood trinkets, and worn-out stuffed animals—and reminisce. Each object is a fragment of my past, a reminder of the person I was and the journey that brought me here. Home is not just a place; it’s a feeling, a collection of moments, voices, languages, and traditions that make up who I am.
