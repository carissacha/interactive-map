    <h1>Miss Porter's School - A Journey of Growth and Independence</h1>
    <p>My time at Miss Porter's was spent at an all-girls boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut. It was my first time leaving home and being independent at such a young age, which taught me a lot about myself.</p>
    
    <p>During these four years, I learned so much about my identity and built lasting friendships with people from all over. However, my experience was also shaped by COVID, which made it tough not being able to return to Hong Kong for long periods.</p>
    
    <p>Despite the challenges, my time at Miss Porter’s was a defining chapter in my life, filled with self-discovery, resilience, and growth.</p>
