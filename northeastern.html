    <h1>Northeastern University - My College Journey</h1>
    <p>Northeastern has been the center of my college life. At this stage of my journey, I spend most of my time here, growing academically, socially, and professionally.</p>
    
    <p>Currently, I am majoring in Data Science and Business with a concentration in Finance. The opportunities at Northeastern, from co-ops to student organizations, have allowed me to expand my knowledge and gain real-world experience.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond academics, I have made many incredible friends and unforgettable memories here. From late-night study sessions to exploring Boston, Northeastern has shaped an important part of who I am today.</p>
