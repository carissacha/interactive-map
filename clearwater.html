    <h1>Clearwater Bay</h1>
    <p>Clearwater Bay isn’t just where I play golf—it’s a place deeply tied to my identity. Every Sunday, my family and I would start with brunch before heading out for a round, making it more than just a routine but a time set aside for each other. The course, the sea breeze, and the familiar rhythm of those days became a constant in my life.  

One of my favorite memories is my 6th birthday. I invited all my friends, and we spent the day at the pool, playing and laughing under the sun. The excitement, the carefree joy, the way the water shimmered—I can still recall it all, especially when I look at old photos.  

Clearwater Bay represents more than just golf; it’s a piece of my identity. It holds the traditions, memories, and sense of belonging that shaped me. When I think about home, it’s not just a place—it’s moments like these, tied to the people and experiences that have stayed with me.</p>
