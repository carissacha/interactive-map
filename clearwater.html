    <h1>Clearwater Bay</h1>
    <p>Clearwater Bay isn’t just where I play golf, it’s a place deeply tied to my identity. Every Sunday, my family and I would start with brunch before heading out for a round, making it more than just a routine but a time set aside for each other. The course, the sea breeze, and the familiar rhythm of those days became a constant in my life.  

    One of my favorite memories is my 4th birthday. I invited all my friends, and we spent the day at the pool, playing and laughing under the sun. The excitement, the carefree joy, the way the water shimmered, I can still recall it all, especially when I look at old photos.  

    Clearwater Bay represents more than just golf; it’s a piece of my identity. It holds the traditions, memories, and sense of belonging that shaped me. When I think about home, it’s not just a place, it’s moments like these, tied to the people and experiences that have stayed with me.</p>
